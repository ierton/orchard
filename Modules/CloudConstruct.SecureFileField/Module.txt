If you enable Content Permissions on the parent Content Item the file field will inherit those permissions for file access. You can choose to store the protected file in a local file folder or remotely in Azure BLOB storage. Lastly, you may serve the file via streaming it to the user from file storage or BLOB storage, or using Shared Access Signature URL's. 
FeatureDescription: Secure a file locally or in Azure BLOB storage based on Content Item Permissions.
